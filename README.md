Avatar-Generator


This is a small project I made using 'HTML', 'CSS', and 'JavaScript'. It lets you create a fun avatar by mixing and matching different parts like add-ons (hats/glasses), tops (shirts), and bottoms (pants).

You can click buttons to change each part or use the 'randomize' button to get a new look every time!

What I Used

- HTML for the layout  
- CSS for styling  
- JavaScript for making things work (like switching images)

What I Learned

- How to change images using JavaScript  
- How to stack images on top of each other using CSS  
- How to use buttons to move through a list of images  
- How to make a simple layout using Flexbox
